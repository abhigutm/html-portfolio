<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hii, my name is Abhishek Gautam and I am a website developer. I have created many projects listed on my website. I have 6 years of 
    experience. I have worked in 3 companies. I’m currently working as a front-end developer at TCS, where I’ve been focusing on 
    building responsive web applications using React and JavaScript. </p>

<p>One of the recent projects I led was the development of an e-commerce platform’s front-end using React and Tailwind CSS. I was 
    responsible for building reusable components and ensuring the site’s responsiveness across different devices, which resulted
     in a 20% increase in mobile user engagement.</p>
